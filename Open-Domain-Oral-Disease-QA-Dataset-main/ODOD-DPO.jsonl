The symptoms you're experiencing -- swollen gums around a tooth and bad breath -- could be indicative of a dental condition such as:\nPericoronitis: This is an inflammation of the tissue surrounding a third molar, also known as a wisdom tooth. This often happens when the tooth hasn't fully emerged and a flap of gum tissue covers part of the tooth, trapping food and bacteria and leading to infection.\nGingivitis or Periodontitis: These are types of gum diseases that can cause symptoms like swollen gums, bad breath, and loose teeth. Gingivitis is the milder form and can progress to periodontitis if not treated.\nAbscessed tooth: This is an infection at the root of a tooth or between a tooth and the gum. It's usually caused by severe tooth decay, but can also result from trauma to the tooth.\nRegardless of the cause, you should see a dental professional as soon as possible. They can examine your mouth, make a proper diagnosis, and start you on the appropriate treatment. Please don't delay seeking help, because if it's an infection, it won't go away on its own and can spread or become more severe.\nRemember, this advice is based on your brief description and should not take the place of a professional medical consultation.
